We made the following source-code changes with regards to bap-pin-traces:
  1) In order to measure the overhead of taint propagation, we removed code responsible for
     logging traces to file.
  2) Also, to attain better overhead measurements, we removed control-flow hijacking detection
     built in bap-pin-traces.
